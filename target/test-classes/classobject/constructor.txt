Class Initializers and Constructors
====================================

Class: we will use class to represent our own custom data type in java progarmming langauge

We have to provide three parts:
1. Fields
2. Constructors
3. Methods

make use of class ===> We will create an object 

When an object is created, it is expected to be in a useful state 
- Often the default state is created by java if you do not provide initial state 

* Java provides three way for establishing useful initial state
 1)  Field Initialization 
 2)  Initialization blocks
 3)  Constructor
 
 Chaining constructors:
 * Once constructor can call another constructor
  - use this() followed by parameter list 
  - usage of this() must the 1st line
  
  
 Initialization and Construction Order:
 ---------------------------------------
 1st:  Filed Initialization
 2nd:  Initialization Block 
 3rd:  Constructors  
 
 
 Summary:
 ==============
 * Objects should be created in some useful state.
 * Fields initializers provide an initial values as part of declaration.
 * Every class has at least one constructor 
 	- if no construct : java will put default constructor 
 	- You can provide as many constructor as you want. 
 * Once constructor can call another constructor 
    - this( pram-list ),<--- it has to be the first line of code
