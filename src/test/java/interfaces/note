Creating Abstract Relationships with Interface:
-----------------------------------------------
menu:
	1. What an interface is
	2. Implementing an interface
	3. Implementing multiple interfaces
	4. Declaring an interface 
	
$ What an interface is: 
  - "an interface defines a contract"
 (defines) [Entity 1] <--------> [Entity 2] (Implements)
            interface			  class
            
      - Class implements interface, 
      - class conforms to the contract
    
    * interface do not limit other aspects of the class' implements 
    * Classes are freee to implement as many interface as they wish. 
    
$ Declaring an interface
	1. It is similar to declaring a class, you have to use
	   "interface" keyword
	2. Thing that you can list out in interface
		- methods:  it is always  "public"
		- constant: it is always  "public final static"
	3. Interface can extend other interface 


Interface Summary: 
==================
* An interface defines a contract 
	- provide no implementations, they just ask the methods 
	- can include methods ( public ) and constants ( static public final ) 
* Classes implements interface 
	- classes are able to implement multiple interfaces 
* Interfaces are able to extend other interface
	- implementing an extended interface implicitly implements the base
